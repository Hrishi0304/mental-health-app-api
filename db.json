The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care. It is not a screening tool for depression but it is used to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment. However, it can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression in at-risk populations - eg, those with coronary heart disease or after stroke.",
